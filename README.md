First OOP JavaScript Game

This game taught me how useful OOP actually is.
Also it was nice to learn about the canvas in html.

The project has to fulfill these checkpoints:
- nice Background
- Canvas should be responsive on all screens
- landscape mode
- game works
- touch should work on mobile
- option to turn music on and off
- when endboss is killed then game over screen is displayed
- keyboard usage explained
- no scrollbar inside the game
